# Incorrect Usage of $inc Operator in MongoDB Update Operation

This example demonstrates an incorrect usage of the `$inc` operator in a MongoDB update operation. The `$inc` operator is used to increment or decrement a numeric field.  Attempting to increment with a string will lead to an error.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.
